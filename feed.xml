Metals can not only be kept with as little loss as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable that they are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number of parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be re-united again; a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess, and which more than any other quality renders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and circulation.</p> </li> <li> <p>I believe, the avarice and injustice of princes and sovereign states, abusing the confidence of their subjects, have by degrees diminished the real quantity of metal, which had been originally contained in their coins</p> </li> <li> <p>The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.</p> </li> <li> <p>The power which that possession (fortune) immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of purchasing; a certain command over all the labour, or over all the produce of labour which is then in the market</p> </li> <li> <p>Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared.

Peter Lynch aptly compared this behavior to ‘cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.’”</p> </li> <li> <p>“A person with average vision doesn’t need to look for a needle in a haystack.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“When dumb money acknowledges its limitations, it is no longer dumb.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The stock market is a place that constantly repositions itself, where money flows from the active to the patient.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“We don’t believe it’s possible to achieve long-term investment success by merely hopping from one flower to another, especially under market pressure, whether due to financial or psychological stress. Calling those who frequently trade ‘investors’ is as absurd as calling those who prefer one-night stands ‘romantics.’”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket closely.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Price is what you pay, value is what you get.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The costs of frequent trading activities can harm long-term investments.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Splits increase trading costs as they double the turnover rate; they attract short-term traders who focus excessively on short-term market fluctuations; and for these reasons, splits can cause stock prices to deviate significantly from the intrinsic value of the company.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Exceptional scarce companies have two qualities: they possess excellent economic characteristics, i.e., moats, and their executives have outstanding management skills, capable of realizing the potential of poorly operated companies and achieving feats ordinary people cannot.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The market is ideal for any investor, no matter the size, as long as they stick to their investment system. Market fluctuations caused by fund managers with vast assets actually provide real investors with more prudent investment opportunities.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Only under tough market conditions, when investors are forced to sell due to financial or psychological stress, are they harmed by market fluctuations.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Our goal is to discover outstanding companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at cheap prices.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“There’s really no difference between buying controlling shares of a company or purchasing publicly traded shares on the market.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“In calculating value, growth is actually a component of value.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Consciously paying a high price for a stock, hoping to sell it quickly at an even higher price, should be labeled as speculation.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Growth is beneficial to investors only if every dollar funding the growth creates more than one dollar of market value in the long run.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The most valuable companies are those that can consistently utilize incremental capital to achieve high returns over an extended period; conversely, the worst companies are those that need or will require continuous large capital inputs but offer low returns.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“For most people in investing, it’s not important what they know; what’s more important is that they know what they don’t know.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“A smart stock investor will do better in the secondary stock market than by participating in IPOs.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“No matter the genius or effort, some things take time. Even if you can make nine women pregnant at the same time, you can’t make them deliver a baby in one month.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Being unmoved like a mountain makes us like a sage, who does not frantically sell off profitable companies due to slight anticipated changes in the Federal Reserve’s interest rates or changes in the opinions of some Wall Street experts.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Students learning about investing only need to master two lessons: how to assess the value of a company and how to deal with market prices.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“As an investor, your goal is simple: to purchase at a rational price a business that is easy to understand, whose earnings are expected to grow significantly from today to the next five, ten, or twenty years. Over time, you will find that not many companies meet these criteria, so when you do find one that does, you should buy in significantly, not just dabble for fun.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Fools will give you reasons; the wise never will.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“We don’t get penalized for not swinging at bad pitches, but standing at the plate with the bat on our shoulders day after day isn’t a pleasant situation either.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Unless you’re a professional liquidator, the ‘cigarette butt’ strategy is foolish.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“If there’s one cockroach in the kitchen, there are likely more.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“A good jockey will perform well only on a good horse; on a poor horse, they will accomplish nothing.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Take it slow, no rush.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“We still haven’t learned how to solve the problems of troubled businesses; what we have learned is to avoid them.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Great investment opportunities occur when a superb company encounters a one-time solvable problem.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“We prefer to sidestep monsters rather than slay them.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“No matter how long a string of numbers you have, if you multiply it by zero, the result will always be zero.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The success of Las Vegas is built on the transfer of wealth, a transfer fueled by people’s eagerness to partake in games of capital transfer that seem small but are disadvantageous.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Imagine a 25-year-old MBA student considering merging his future economic interests with those of a 25-year-old day laborer; the MBA student would find that merging his equity with the laborer’s on a stock-for-stock basis would greatly enhance his short-term gains, but what deal could be more foolish?”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Go to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“One day, a man went to the veterinarian and said, ‘Can you help me? Sometimes my horse walks fine, and other times it limps.’ The vet’s response was straightforward: ‘No problem, sell him when he walks fine.’”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Sellers have far more knowledge about the company than buyers, and they choose the timing of the sale.”</p> </li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/buffet2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/buffet2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/buffet2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/buffet2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 50%; " title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <ul> <li> <p>“If your actions are reasonable, you are bound to get good results; in most cases, leverage merely accelerates the motion of things.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Leverage is addictive; once you miraculously profit from it, few people are willing to return to their previous conservative state.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Cash and credit are like oxygen; when abundant, people don’t notice their presence, but their importance is realized only when they are gone.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Gold has two major drawbacks: it’s not very useful, and it can’t reproduce itself.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“When we hear everyone saying ‘cash is king’, that is exactly the time to deploy cash, not hold it; when everyone says cash is trash, that is the era when fixed-income products are the most attractive we can remember.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The ideal investment asset should be one that continues to provide an output that preserves its purchasing power during inflation with very little need for new capital investment.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Falling stock prices benefit us, rising stock prices harm us.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“We like doing business in a pessimistic environment, not because we like pessimism, but because we like the prices it brings. For a rational buyer, optimism is the enemy.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Of course, this doesn’t mean that merely because a business or stock is unpopular, buying them is the right action. Such an idea is also a foolish following of the crowd. What is required here is independent thought, not echoing others.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Most people would rather die than think.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The business world is full of pitfalls, and a business plan that demands avoiding all pitfalls is itself a disaster.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The wise initiate, the foolish conclude.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The payment method of zero-coupon bonds establishes this principle: if you solemnly promise not to pay a penny for a long time, then you will not default for a long time.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Even a high school dropout knows that if you borrow money to buy a car, your income must not only cover the interest on the loan and the running costs of the car, but also the true depreciation calculated. If he talks about EBITDA when borrowing from the bank, he would flee amid derision.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“When issuing bonds, investment bankers show their humorous side by presenting financial data, income statements, and balance sheets for the next five years or more for companies they had only heard about a few months ago.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“(On misappropriated funds) Before being discovered, the person who misappropriates the funds becomes rich by embezzlement, and the person from whom the funds are misappropriated does not feel poor. This stolen wealth should be added to the national wealth so that we understand the mental wealth of the nation.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“(Sarcastically) Logically, a society that needs to feel huge prosperity should encourage its citizens to misappropriate funds and also strive to avoid being discovered. In this way, even without productive work, wealth will inflate.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Foolish prices always attract sellers.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Trading is the lifeblood of finance.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Mistakes often happen at the time of decision.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Bankruptcy courts have become the sanatoriums of airlines.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The mistakes made in derivatives are asymmetrical. They almost always favor traders eyeing millions in bonuses, or CEOs hoping to report eye-catching profits, or both.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“History tells us that a crisis that causes problems is often triggered during a calm period by a series of unexpected events.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“When Munger and I read the lengthy disclosures of major banks’ derivatives, the only thing we can understand is that we really don’t know how much risk these institutions are taking on.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“When a problem occurs, whether in personal life or business, the best time to act is immediately.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“I liked you more before I knew you.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The graveyard of prophets is filled mostly with macro analysts.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Stock buybacks should meet two conditions: first, a company must have ample cash for operations and liquidity needs; second, the stock price must be far below a conservatively estimated intrinsic value.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“It’s not just about saying that buybacks are to offset the dilutive impact of stock issuance, or just because a company has surplus cash, that we should buy back shares. Unless the buyback price is below intrinsic value, those shareholders who remain will be harmed.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The first rule of capital allocation often is that you may be smart at one price but foolish at another.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Those who buy for non-value reasons will also sell for non-value reasons.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Brokers sing praises for companies with huge turnover; they can’t fill your pockets, but they can fill your ears.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“What’s beneficial for the casino manager may not necessarily benefit the clients.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“An overly active stock market is a pickpocket to businesses.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Adam Smith believed that in a free market, various non-collusive actions are guided by an invisible hand towards the optimization of economic progress; our view is that in a casino-like market, impatient investment managers play an invisible foot, constantly tripping up the forward-moving economy, slowing down economic development.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Noah’s rule: The important thing is to build the ark, not to predict the rain.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“You shouldn’t use gold valued as lead to buy gold valued as gold.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Don’t ask a barber if you need a haircut.”</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="the-art-of-war">The Art of War</h2> <div class="row"> <div> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sunzi-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sunzi-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sunzi-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/sunzi.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 50%; " title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <ul> <li> <p>“Warfare is a matter of vital importance to the state; it is a matter of life and death, a road either to survival or to ruin.

Who has the ability? Who has the advantage of heaven and earth? Whose discipline is effective? Whose troops are stronger? Whose officers and men are more trained? Who administers rewards and punishments more clearly? From these, I can predict success or failure.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The general must possess wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, and strictness.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Momentum is manipulating the force of the situation to your advantage.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Warfare is the way of deception.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Appear where you are not expected; show weakness when you are strong, and strength when you are weak.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Entice the enemy with bait, strike chaos, prepare against him where he is unprepared, avoid him where he is strong, irritate him, humble him, exhaust him, disunite him.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Attack where he is unprepared, come at him when he does not expect it.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Those who win without fighting are calculated in advance; their victories are not due to chance.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“In employing troops, when you utilize the enemy’s provisions, every bushel of food taken from the enemy is equivalent to twenty you can use.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“When using forces, the expense of maintaining vehicles and provisions across a thousand li and feeding hundreds of thousands can be costly. Hence, swift victory is important.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Long-lasting warfare has never benefited any country.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Therefore, those who do not know the harms of using troops cannot fully understand the benefits of using them.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The best policy is to capture the state intact; it should be destroyed only if no other options are available.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Military tactics involve calculations that can be compared to the crossing of a river; do not move until all the advantages are in your favor.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“In battle, engage the enemy in a way that conforms to the situation.

Those who can adapt and change in accord with the enemy and achieve victory are divine.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“The Five Elements do not always overcome each other, the Four Seasons do not have a constant position, the sun has its periods of short and long, the moon has its periods of waxing and waning.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Raising an army to fight for profit will fail; deploying an army to compete for profit will lose its support.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“An army without its baggage train is lost; without provisions, it is lost; without bases of supply, it is lost.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“War is based on deception, moves as an advantage emerges, changes through dividing and reuniting.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Its rapidity is like the wind, its slowness like the forest; it invades like fire, it is immovable like a mountain.

Therefore the sage holds to the one as the model for the world.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Not displaying himself, he shines; not justifying himself, he is distinguished; not boasting, he receives recognition; not bragging, he never wanes.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“By not contending, no one in the world can contend with him.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Rare words are natural.”</p> </li> <li> <p>(By Su Zhe) “The way that is expressed in words is tasteless, it cannot be seen, it cannot be heard, but it cannot be exhausted.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Morning winds don’t last, sudden rains don’t last all day.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Thus, those who proceed in the way are aligned with the Tao, those who attain virtue are aligned with virtue, those who lose are aligned with loss. Those aligned with the Tao, the Tao also is pleased to gain them; those aligned with virtue, virtue also is pleased to gain them; those aligned with loss, loss also is pleased to gain them.”</p> </li> <li> <p>“Those who stand on tiptoes do not stand firmly.
