During this research, I explored and visualized speculative behavior by measuring metrics such as total generation time, latency, and correct speculation rate, and traced time taken and tokens generated for each iteration as potential side channels. Additionally, I developed and executed fingerprinting attacks and timing side-channel attacks using advanced machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Bottleneck Network, and pretrained Transformers, yielding promising results. Through this process, I gained solid experience in shell programming and efficiently utilizing SLURM schedulers to load and run jobs on GPUs. I regularly prepared and presented detailed progress reports, demonstrating complex findings and advancements.","highlights":["Large Language Models","Robotics","Cloud Computing","Unity","C#","Prompt Design","HTTP Clients"]},{"name":"MEDCVR Lab, University of Toronto","position":"Robotics Researcher","url":"https://medcvr.utm.utoronto.ca/","startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-04-20","summary":"I spearheaded the integration of LLMs as the lower-level controller and trajectory planner for robotics, ensuring fault tolerance by detecting and correcting failures midway. I designed LLM prompts and deployed LLM within Unity using C#, significantly enhanced real-time application performance.
