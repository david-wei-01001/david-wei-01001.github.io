## WelcomeðŸ‘‹! I'm David Wei! 
Iâ€™m David (Jiankun) Wei, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science with a deep passion for generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and robotics. 

I am currently exploring potential side channel attacks on speculative decoding that used to accelerate LLM inferences. Another project I worked on involved integrating LLMs into robotics control systems, using Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.0 pro vision to perform teleoperation in simulated remote surgery environments.

Throughout my academic career, Iâ€™ve maintained a 3.99 GPA and received numerous academic awards. I have presented my research at the Undergraduate Summer Research Program and engaged with other research teams. Iâ€™ve also worked on diverse projects, including performing object detection with Detectron2 and developing cryptocurrency platforms without prior experience in web design, demonstrating my ability to quickly master new skills. Additionally, my research into the Chinese real estate sector involved processing large datasets, conducting sentiment analysis, and identifying risks in market trends, further sharpening my data analysis and problem-solving abilities.

When not advancing the field of AI, I savor the joy of reading and culinary explorations. :ï¼‰ Also feel free to check out my projects, where each line of code may turn a new page in tech innovation~ ^-^
