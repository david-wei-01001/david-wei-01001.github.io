## WelcomeðŸ‘‹! I'm David Wei! 
I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. Iâ€™m particularly interested in artificial intelligence, specifically the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative modeling and their applications in various scenarios such as Robotics and Medicare.

I am currently exploring potential side channel attacks on speculative decoding that used to accelerate LLM inferences. Due to the different heuristics empowering each speculative schemes and different input queries prompting the LLMs, the model may respond with different speed. This per token time difference may present a potential side channel that can be exploited to unveil the internal model parameters, user inputs, or the actual outputs. This is crucial nowadays as more and more people rely on LLM for personal advices, and such a successful attack may leak many personal data. 

Before this, I have been working on Robotics decision-making and navigation, pushing the boundaries of traditional robotics by integrating adaptive LLM strategies to ensure percise movement with fault-tolerence. 

When not advancing the field of AI, I savor the joy of reading and culinary explorations. :ï¼‰ Also feel free to check out my projects, where each line of code may turn a new page in tech innovation~ ^-^
