## WelcomeðŸ‘‹! I'm David Wei! 
Iâ€™m David (Jiankun) Wei, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science with a deep passion for generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and robotics. 

I am currently exploring potential side channel attacks on speculative decoding that used to accelerate LLM inferences. Since the main bottleneck of each autogressive step is the one pass of target models, each iteration takes similar time. But due to the different behaviors of Small Language Models or heuristics empowering each speculative schemes and different input queries prompting the LLMs, the modeloutput different number of tokens per iteration. This per token time trace presents a potential side channel that can be exploited to unveil the internal hyperparameters of speculation mechanisms, user inputs, or the Intellectual Properties used to build speculation heuristics (such as data stores). In some cases, speculative decoding may also bypass model safeguards and expereincing degrades in generation quality. This is crucial nowadays as more and more people rely on LLM for personal advices, and such a successful attack may leak many personal data. Another project I worked on involved integrating LLMs into robotics control systems, using Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.0 to perform teleoperation in simulated remote surgery environments.

Throughout my academic career, Iâ€™ve maintained a 3.99 GPA and received numerous academic awards. I have presented my research at the Undergraduate Summer Research Program and engaged with other research teams. Iâ€™ve also worked on diverse projects, including performing object detection with Detectron2 and developing cryptocurrency platforms without prior experience in web design, demonstrating my ability to quickly master new skills. Additionally, my research into the Chinese real estate sector involved processing large datasets, conducting sentiment analysis, and identifying risks in market trends, further sharpening my data analysis and problem-solving abilities.

When not advancing the field of AI, I savor the joy of reading and culinary explorations. :ï¼‰ Also feel free to check out my projects, where each line of code may turn a new page in tech innovation~ ^-^
